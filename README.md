# cache-go

Github Action to restore and save cached Go module and build files as efficiently as possible.

Module and build files are cached separately to avoid not restoring cached build files because
dependencies were changed. Likewise a Go version upgrade should not invalidate cached module
files as they aren't dependent on a specific Go version. Cache restore keys are used to ensure
a cache will be loaded whenever possible.

## Inputs

  required: false
  default: ${{ github.job }}-mod-
build-key:

  required: false
  default: ${{ github.job }}-${{ runner.os }}-${GO_VERSION}-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}
